        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For those that haven’t played before, the idea is to pick one team each day to advance in the tournament. If they win, you move on; if they lose, you’re out—no buying back in.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve picked a team, you cannot pick them again. If you run out of teams to pick, you are considered out if there are still others alive.</p>
        <p>Winner takes all if there is no tie. In the event of a tie, the pot will be split up by adding up the seeds of the correct picks.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fill out your contact information using <a href="https://dcm5ds.github.io/march-madness-survivor-pool/contact-info-submission.html">this link</a>.</li>
            <li>Venmo $5 to <strong>@david-mcquillen</strong>. Entry fee is due this Friday at noon.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have Venmo, shoot me a text and we can figure something out.</li>
            <li>Make your picks using the <a href="https://dcm5ds.github.io/march-madness-survivor-pool/pick-submission.html">Pick Submission page</a>.</li>
            <li>When submitting, your name must match the contact info supplied in Step 1.</li>
            <li>You can make any number of submissions if you change your mind, up until the tipoff of the first game that day.</li>
            <li>Once a valid selection has been made, you will see "Pick Submitted" next to your name in the pool.</li>
            <li>After the cutoff time each day, the final picks for the entire pool will be revealed.</li>
            <li>Picks are invalid if you have already picked that team, or if the submission timestamp is after the cutoff time.</li>
        </ul>
